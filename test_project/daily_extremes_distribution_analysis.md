# Daily Extremes Distribution Analysis

## PROJECT BACKGROUND
This project was my first ever algorithmic trading system, and was used to gain experience and acts as preparation for my big project. Was done within 1 day, and very satisfied with the result and knowledge gained. I use this experience to move on to the big project of quantifying my current profitable discretionary trading strategy.

## When Do Daily Highs/Lows Occur? (Frankfurt Open Onwards)

### SUMMARY
Total Sample: 1,254 trading days
- Bearish Days (Daily Highs): 642 days
- Bullish Days (Daily Lows): 612 days

### KEY FINDINGS
HIGH PROBABILITY WINDOWS:
- 09:00-10:00: 76.8% of daily extremes occur here
- 09:00-11:00: 95.4% cumulative probability
- 15:00-17:00: Secondary cluster (39.3%)

LOW ACTIVITY PERIODS:
- 18:00-22:00: Only 8.3% of extremes
- Minimal overnight risk after 18:00

TRADING IMPLICATIONS:
1. Position sizing: Reduce size before 09:00 GMT+3
2. Stop management: Tighten stops during 09:00-11:00
3. Entry timing: Avoid new positions 18:00+ 
4. Risk-off periods: 12:00-14:00 (lowest volatility)

### TECHNICAL NOTES
- Data source: Frankfurt open onwards
- Timezone: GMT+3
- Sample period: 2017.01.10 to 2025.07.02
- Methodology: Daily high/low identification

### STRATEGY VALIDATION
The research directly informed this profitable automated system:
- Leveraged 09:00-11:00 high-volatility window
- Confirmed Frankfurt opening as optimal entry timing
- Applied range-break methodology with disciplined exits
- Achieved consistent profitability over 8+ years of data

### OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES
This distribution analysis provides the foundation for systematic optimization across 9 key variables:
- Target/Stop multipliers based on range size
- Entry timing refinements using hourly probabilities
- Risk management adjustments for high/low volatility periods
- Parameter optimization framework detailed in development plan

For complete optimization methodology, see: `frankfurt_strategy_development_plan.md`

### NEXT STEPS
Moving forward to quantify and systematize my profitable discretionary trading approach based on learnings from this foundational project.
