## Phase 1: Market Structure Analysis

### Initial Hypothesis
Frankfurt and London sessions dominate EUR/USD price action due to:
- Highest liquidity concentration
- Major economic announcements
- Institutional order flow

### Data Analysis Methodology
- **Dataset:** EUR/USD M5 data (2017-2025)
- **Sample Size:** 1,254 trading days
- **Focus:** Daily High/Low distribution from Frankfurt open onwards
- **Classification:** Bullish days (Close > Open) vs Bearish days (Close < Open)

### Key Findings: Daily Extremes Distribution

| Time (GMT+3) | Bearish Days (HOD) | Bullish Days (LOD) | Combined |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| 09:00        | 20.1%            | 17.5%            | 37.6%    |
| 10:00        | 19.3%            | 19.9%            | 39.2%    |
| 11:00        | 9.3%             | 9.3%             | 18.6%    |
| 12:00-22:00  | 23.3%            | 24.3%            | 47.6%    |

**Critical Insight:** 76.8% of daily price extremes occur within the first two hours (09:00-10:00 GMT+3)

### Market Logic Validation
- **Bearish Days:** Daily highs typically form early, followed by decline
- **Bullish Days:** Daily lows typically form early, followed by advance
- **Range Theory:** Early extremes often represent session boundaries that hold as support/resistance

## Phase 2: Strategy Development

### Core Strategy Logic
Based on the statistical distribution, developed a range breakout system:

1. **Range Definition:** 08:00-10:59 Frankfurt time (GMT+3, DST adjusted)
2. **Entry Signal:** Price breaks range boundaries after 11:00
3. **Direction Bias:** 
   - Long breakout above range → Range low likely holds as support
   - Short breakout below range → Range high likely holds as resistance

### Entry Methodology Testing

Tested multiple entry approaches to optimize execution:

| Method | Description | Performance vs Benchmark |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Market Buy (1 pip breakout)** | Immediate entry on range break + 1 pip | **BEST** ✅ |
| Retracement Entries (30%-61.8%) | Wait for pullback before entry | Underperformed |
| Close-Based Confirmations (M5-H1) | Wait for candle close above/below range | Close, but inferior |

**Winner:** Simple market entry on breakout + 1 pip buffer
- **Rationale:** Market expansion phases show shallow retracements
- **Execution:** Momentum-based approach captures more of the move

## Phase 3: Systematic Optimization

### Optimization Framework
Implemented comprehensive parameter testing across 9 key variables:

#### Core Strategy Parameters
- `target_multiplier`: Take-profit as multiple of range size (0.3x - 1.5x)
- `stop_multiplier`: Stop-loss as multiple of range size (0.8x - 2.0x)
- `stop_method`: Fixed ratio vs range-opposite methodology

#### Risk Management Parameters
- `breakout_buffer`: Entry trigger distance (0.5-5.0 pips)
- `min_range_pips`: Minimum valid range size (3-15 pips)
- `max_range_pips`: Maximum valid range size (30-80 pips)

#### Timing Parameters
- `range_duration`: Range calculation period (currently 3 hours)
- `entry_delay_minutes`: Wait time after range close (0-60 minutes)
- `trade_cutoff_hour`: Daily trading deadline (15:00-20:00 GMT+3)

### Optimization Process
- **Total Combinations Tested:** 10,000+ parameter sets
- **Minimum Trade Threshold:** 10+ trades per combination
- **Optimization Metrics:** Total pips, win rate, risk-reward ratio
- **Validation:** Walk-forward analysis on out-of-sample data
